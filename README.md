> **Abstract:**  _Single-pixel imaging (SPI) enables the use of advanced detector technologies to provide a potentially low-cost solution for sensing beyond the visible spectrum and has received increasing attentions recently. However, when it comes to sub-Nyquist sampling, the spectrum truncation and spectrum discretization effects significantly challenge the traditional SPI pipeline due to the lack of sufficient sparsity. In this work, a deep compressive sensing (CS) framework is built to conduct image reconstructions in classical SPIs, where a novel compression network is proposed to enable collaborative sparsity in discretized feature space while remaining excellent coherence with the sensing basis as per CS conditions. To alleviate the underlying limitations in an end-to-end supervised training, e.g., the network typically needs to be re-trained as the basis patterns, sampling ratios, etc. change, the network is trained in an unsupervised fashion with no sensing physics involved._

## Datasets
The training datasets used the hyperspectral data from [ICVL](http://icvl.cs.bgu.ac.il/hyperspectral-imaging/). Given our end point applications (fluorescence imaging), only one-channel data were used for training. <br>
The testing on natural images used the data from [Linnaeous](http://localhost:6001/#images) datasets. <br>
The in-vivo fluorescence imaging data can be downloaded [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1EiF5YkjjWnM7tHEG711l7g). (PWD: 1234) <br>

## Training networks
To train the network, run the training script below.
```
python train.py -opt options/train.yml
```

## Test networks
To test on simulated SPI measurements, run the script below<br>
```
python main_sim.py -opt options/test.yml
```

To test on experimental SPI measurements, run the script below<br>
```
python main_exp.py -opt options/test.yml
```

Reconstructions from the traditional CS can be performed by running <br>
```
python main_exp_wavelet.py -opt options/test.yml 
```
or
```
python main_sim_wavelet.py -opt options/test.yml
```
